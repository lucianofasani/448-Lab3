                My name is Luciano, I was born in Argentina on July 1st, 1996. My family and I moved
                to Kansas in April of 2001. I graduated from Bonner Springs high school in 2014, went
                to Emporia State University for a year, then transferred to KU. I am currently a junior
                in the Computer Science program at KU with an expected graduation date of December 2018.
